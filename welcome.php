    YESS!! The user authentication system worked! Your password is
    securely stored in the database by a one-way hashing algorithm.
    When signing in, your entered password is hashed & then it compared it with the hashed password in the database.
    If it's a match, the user signs in successfully! Your password is encrypted & is securely stored in the database.
    Not even the database administrator can see it.
